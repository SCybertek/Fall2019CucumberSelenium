//why to have 2 tags? : (like driver and store manager in feature file
//when he found a bug he put tag @Bug_VYT4311 (number from Jira)
//it makes it easy to debug the issue / and we will not forget that this story fails and we already reported it
//it indicates that issue is known = to label bugs
//so can this be an appropriate answer to interview question: How do you run only failed test cases in your suite?

//tags = "not @BUG" to quickly run scenarios that area labeled as a bug
//tags = "@BUG"

//parametrization of text execution
//in TestNG we specify what kind of test we want to run = > this is similar to that

//failed to parseFeatureFiles => syntax is not correct


//are we using the same runner for every feature ? or we change path for that? to run dif. tests?
//yes we can
//we will group tests later and he will show us how to do so





//SEVERE]: Timed out receiving message from renderer: 0.100
//Whoever has this error, itâ€™s all about your current Chrome driver version,
// stable one was 79, but latest is 81, 81 is causing this error,
// you can downgrade or just ignore that error

//ClassNOtFound error => solution : delete .idea folder and restart IntelliJ

//failed to parse feature file => meaning syntax in feature file is Wrong

/**
 *notes from Seda:
 * //our framework creates json file, some plugin takes jason file and generates a nice HTML report
 * //json looks like plain text, has "properties,values" , arrays,Strings,integers,
 * //json object vs java object
 * //json object has only properties no method; java object has both properties and methods
 * //We add json plugin => "json:target/cucumber.json" => to let it generate by our framework
 */

//we need surefire plug in = to run the test without IDE
//we need plugin for Json report in our POM.XML

/**
 *To generate reports :
 * From maven click : verfiy
 * Terminal command => mvn verify / mvn test
 * To clean target file and run => mvn clean verify / mvn clean test
 *  mvn clean verify -q => minimize console log
 * *It does not generate report when you run from cucumberRunner
